"""Meat Engine Widget Set

The term "Widget" in my context is similar to the use of the term in
the X windows system - a control used to build a GUI.

Widgets may be interactive (buttons, sliders) or non-interactive (text
displays, separators, images). Widgets may be containers for other
widgets (sizers, scroll boxes).

This library is intended to be display-neutral, but my principle
interest is drawing to OpenGL.

TODO List

 - pushbutton
 - radio button
