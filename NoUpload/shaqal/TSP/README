Problem : http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/Fall12/CSCI-GA.2965-001/travelingsalesman.html

Given a collection of cities, your job is to have your salesman visit every city at least once and to do so in the cheapest way possible. Salesman must start and end at city 1. The cities will each have three dimensional coordinates. The z coordinate varies the least as most cities are at pretty much the same elevation. The format will be
cityid, x-coord, y-coord, z-coord

Your output should simply give a sequence of cities in the order of visit (one line per city) and the total distance traveled. Note that you do have to return to your home city. Distance traveled is calculated based on Euclidean distance. There will be a list of 1000 cities generated the day of the contest.

Solution:

We used Christofides Algorithm

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm

Perfect Matching which is a substep of the algorithm was implemented by using a library based on Blossom's Algorithm

Heuristic: After Christofies generates a tour we apply 2-opt optimization which basically takes two pairs of cities (c1,c2) and (c3,c4)
If distance between c1,c2 + c3,c4 > c1,c3 + c2,c4 we simply change c2 , c3 in place and reverse the path between them. 

We apply this Heuristic for 100 iterations and we managed to get the solution which was within 1.1 to 1.3% of the optimal solution.


Compile : make
Run : ./blossom5 travelingtest.txt
Output will be in TSPData.txt
